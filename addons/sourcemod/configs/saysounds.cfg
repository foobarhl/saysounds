// # Soundfiles have to be placed relative to your game/mod "sound" folder.							#
// # Example: 	cstrike/sound/mysound.mp3	or		dod/sound/myfolder/mysound.mp3					#
// #			"file"	"mysound.mp3"		or		"file"	"myfolder/mysound.mp3"					#
// # If you run a pure server (sv_pure = 1) you should create an extra folder for your sounds		#
// # so you don't have to whitelist your whole "sound" folder.										#
// # Whitelisting is done in the "pure_server_whitelist.txt" file located in the "hl2" folder.		#
// # Example: sound\myfolder\...	allow_from_disk													#
// # Don't forget to change the map after you've added something to your pure_server_whitelist.txt	#
// # For more infos on pure servers visit http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Pure_Servers		#
